# Experiment 3 - Pattern Generator
[Link to code](/Experiment_3/index.html)

## Description
The experiment I chose tasked me to create an autonous pattern generator that would change it's pattern overtime. For this experiement, I followed a youtube tutorial to make the base for my pattern.

I modified the base code by utilising the random() function to make the project generate random patterns each time. I also added the colour changer feature which I had used in my first experiment, so the pattern would generate in a different colour each second.

## Reflection
This was my favourite experiment out of all three because it shows how a few lines of code can create such an abstract artpiece. However, there were some features which I wish I could of added or improved to make the piece look better. Due to the light background, whenever it would change to a light colour, the pattern would not be visible. I wanted to find a solution where the pattern generator could would not change into those lighter colours. My previous attempts cause my generator to break, and due to the limit time, I had to keep what I had working. But if I were given the time, I would have played around more with trying different shapes and limiting the colour choices for the generator.
