# Experiment 2 - Paint Took
[Link to code](/Experiment_2/index.html)

## Description
The experiment I chose tasked me to create a painting tool with 3 different brush variations. 

In my painting tool I had three bursh options. 1 - A defualt brush, 2 - An Eraser, 3 - Chaos Brush.

For the chaos brush, I use different shapes and colours that would spread out (like an airbrush). It did not end up acting as an air brush as the triangle shape did not work with the variables I gave it, causing it to look more chaotic than intended.

I also added a 'clear canvas' button to quickly erase the drawings

## Reflection
The painting tool works as intended, however I struggled with preventing the brush from overlapping with the menu border. I tried using the constrain() function like I did in the first experiment but it would not work. I feel like I could of done more to make the painting tool looked more polished, such as styled the menu border a bit more or added more features such as a colour wheel or brush sizes.  However, I was running low on time due to my lack of time management for this assessment, so I did not get to add any more features which I wanted to add.
