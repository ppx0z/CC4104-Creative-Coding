#Experiment 1 - Moire Effect
[Link to code](/Experiment_1/index.html)

##Description
The experiment I chose tasked me to create a moire effect program which has three different variations. 

For the first variation, whenever the user would move their mouse from left to right, the size of the cursor to move, causing the moire effect.

For the second variation, I tried using a different shape and made it so it would randomly change it's size without the user's input.

For the third variation, it was similar to the first, however I changed it so the colour of the cursor would change from time to time. I also messed around with the settings a bit to make it rounder.

##Reflection
It took alot of trial and error for me to understand how to create background pattern as I had slightly forgotten how for loops/while loops worked. I tended to avoid using for loops whenever I experimented in projects during creative coding lectures. It had also been awhile since I touched codelabs, so I was a bit rusty in that regard. 

It made me realise that I had to constantly keep practicing/experimenting in coding in order for me to keep the knowledge fresh in my mind.
